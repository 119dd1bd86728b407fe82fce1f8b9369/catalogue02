# The-Game-of-Hog

https://github.com/flybunctious/The-Game-of-Hog
<blockquote>
Introduction In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. You will need to use control statements and higher-order functions together, as described in Sections 1.2 through 1.6 of Composing Programs.  In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes.  To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:  Pig Out. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1. Example 1: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They score 1 point for the turn. Example 2: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn. Free Bacon. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one more than the largest digit in the opponent's total score. ...

# NodeMCU-ESP8266

https://github.com/dfalt0/NodeMCU-ESP8266
<blockquote>
This software allows you to perform a deauth attack with an ESP8266 against selected networks. The ESP8266 is a cheap and easy to use Wi-Fi SoC (System-on-a-Chip), programmable with the Arduino IDE. With this software flashed onto it, you can select a target network and start different attacks.  The deauth attack will, if the connection is vulnerable, disconnect the devices from the network. Because the attack is running constantly, the devices will be disconnected again and again. Depending on the network, that can either block a connection or slow it down.  The difference between deauthing and jamming: WiFi Jammers vs Deauthers | What's The Difference?  Other attacks also have been implemented, such as beacon and probe request flooding.  The deauth attack works by exploiting an old and known vulnerability in the 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol. Because these deauthentication frames, usually used to close a Wi-Fi connection safely, are unencrypted, it's very easy to spoof them.
