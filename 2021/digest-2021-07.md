Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms The Measurement Services customer agreeing to these terms (“Customer”) has entered into an agreement with either Google or a third party reseller (as applicable) for the provision of the Measurement Services (as amended from time to time, the “Agreement”) through which services user interface Customer has enabled the Data Sharing Setting.  These Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms (“Controller Terms”) are entered into by Google and Customer.

# -9-Email-Marketing-Tips-For-Content-Marketers

https://github.com/ZulqarnainZilli/-9-Email-Marketing-Tips-For-Content-Marketers
<blockquote>
 9 Email Marketing Tips For Content Marketers Even “agnostics” regarding email marketing can't hash out the following evidence - the average ROI from this promotional practice is close to 3,800%. Measureless opportunities to scale up and relative cheapness, compared to other reaching-out channels, are the two reasons why the email marketing is fair-haired by businesses. However, this is not about the price and physical extent alone.  The chief advantage is a better alignment of communication with customers. If you hope a certain content strategy brings desirable results, overlooking the quality of mailing messages will be a sorry pitfall. Always keep in mind that newsletters, welcome, retention, and other emails are not just a brand's facade - but a powerful tool for generating conversions. By joining sides of email and content strategies, you can come up with synergy from both. In this guide, we’ll cover a few recommendations for content marketers on how to write email messages that w...
