<blockquote>
Robot researchers need the simulator to test their functions and algorithm before implementing into the real robot. Most of the time, a customizable Robot simulator is not available to the researcher. Some good options are available in the market, but their price is too high, not affordable. After much research, we found a better solution around all aspects, fully customizable and entirely free of cost. There are two sides. One is a 3D view of robotics ARM, and another is a joint controller of robotics ARM. For 3D simulation, CoppeliaSim is the best option. It is free of cost and Open Source. The C&amp;&#35;35; language is becoming famous for its managed code structure and ease of implementation. Our Robot controller is in the C&amp;&#35;35; language. For control and debug we use Microsoft visual studio 2019. It is an unparallel IDE for the programmer. In the CoppeliaSim little bit, Lua script is in associated functions. Communication Between the simulator and our application, we will use Remote API F...

# SQL-Challenge-

https://github.com/presidentmanny/SQL-Challenge-
<blockquote>
 It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:   Data Modeling   Data Engineering   Data Analysis    Before You Begin   Create a new folder in your homework repository called sql-challenge.   Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the SQL challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: EmployeeSQL.   Add your files to this folder.   Push the above changes to GitHub.    Instructions  Data Modeling Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.
